# Python_Modular_BankAccount
Add two subclasses (use inheritance):
 Savings account with interest 
 Checking account with transfer limitation
Create protected and private members:
 Account number
 Routing number
 Put each class in a separate module
Create a main file to run your program:
 Import saving and checking class into main file.
 Create a scenario (i.e a user opens a checking account and withdraws $x) and call proper methods to illustrate the scenario.
 Create at least two different instances from each to make sure it works.
